## Getting Started with R

Download and install the appropriate [version of R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Rather than using the default R interface, we recommend downloading [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) built specifically to make a range of tasks easier in R.

For new coders, it may be important to stress that R and RStudio _are not_ the same thing. R is a programming language and can be used without RStudio. RStudio is a program designed to provide a graphical interface that allows one to write code, view data, and render visualizations, among other convenient features.

If you aren't yet familiar with RStudio, take a minute to familiarize yourself with the interface with this short [tour of the program](https://www.r-bloggers.com/a-tour-of-rstudio/). You should be comfortable with each pane and its functions, as well as understand the difference between writing code in R scripts versus entering code into the console.

Here's a sneak peak of the RStudio user interface:

## Getting Started with SAS

Brown University students can download the most recent version of SAS (pronounced "sass") from [Brown's software catalogue](https://www.brown.edu/information-technology/software/catalog/sas-1). You must log in to your student account to download the necessary software.

Windows and Linux users should download the SAS 9.4 version that corresponds to their operating system as well as SAS Enterprise Guide. While SAS comes with a user interface, Enterprise Guide serves a similar purpose for SAS as RStudio does for R. Acquaint yourself with its [interface](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/factsheet/sas-enterprise-guide-101431.pdf).

Unfortunately, Mac users will need to use the server-based version of SAS University because local downloads of SAS 9.4 and SAS Enterprise Guide **are not** available for macOS.

<dev-note>Consider providing instructions to download a virtual machine, install Linux (Mint or Ubuntu), and then install SAS 9.4 for Linux.</dev-note>
