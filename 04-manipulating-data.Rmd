# Working with Data

## Objects in R

The first thing to keep in mind when working in R is that, by default, all objects are stored in the global environment when you assign them. An object stored to the global environment will be accessible from anywhere in a project once assigned.

These objects can be any of the data types or structures we saw a couple of sections ago.

<span class="marginnote">Note that we can also assign objects as so: `y = 10`. However, using the equal sign is generally not preferred because it is used to assign values to function arguments, too.</span>

To begin, though, we'll assign single values to several variables using `<-`, known as the assignment operator. One important thing to keep in mind when working in R is that all names are **case-sensitive**, meaning that R considers `myvariable` and `myVariable` to be two different objects.

<span class="marginnote">Can you name the data types for each object we just assigned? Write 3 more lines and wrap each object name in a `class()` function.</span>

```{r assign}
x1 <- 10
x2 <- "Welcome to Brown!"
x3 <- TRUE
```

To view what's stored in those variables, we print them to the console.

```{r print}
# note that in some cases, you may want use the print() function
x1
x2
x3
```
We can also perform manipulations with them:

```{r manipulate}
x1 * 10
paste(x2, "We can do many things with the paste() function!")
```

With `x3`, we can do a couple of things because Booleans are also be treated as numerics, in a sense, where `TRUE` equals 1 and `FALSE` equals 0.

<span class="marginnote">Recall the prior <a href="data-structures.html#major-differences-between-r-and-sas">discussion</a> of R as a functional language. Here, we pass the object `x3` to the function `isTRUE`.</span>

```{r boolean.var}
# test whether x3 is TRUE
isTRUE(x3)

# test whether x3 is FALSE
isFALSE(x3)

# multiply TRUE (1) times 5
x3 * 5
```
These are very simple examples, of course, but hopefully they provide some inkling as to how the different data types can be combined and manipulated to achieve various ends. Checking variable values and classes will be a regular task when manipulating data and debugging code.

For instance, if we needed to confirm that `x1` was a numeric variable, we could check it:

```{r check.num.class}
is.numeric(x1)
```

Or we could make sure it took the value we expected:

```{r check.num.value}
x1 == 10
```

Note, that to avoid reassigning `x1`, we used `==`, which is a logical, or comparison, operator.

We'll revisit logical operations in a bit after we review how to manipulate and work with some different types of objects.

## More Complex Objects

When we reviewed data types previously, we saw that R is capable of handling objects such as vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames. Let's have a look at each of these objects in turn, and get a feel for how we can work with them.

### Vectors

You can think of a vector as a sequence of values. In fact, the objects we assigned in the prior section were simply vectors with a length of one.

Creating longer vectors is straightforward but requires a **concatenation** function called `c()`. As we did last time, let's create a few vectors.

<span class="marginnote definition">**Concatenation** Merging or joining multiple objects into one.</span>

```{r vector.examples}
x1_vec <- c(50, 21, 455, 89, 09)
x2_vec <- c("Hi!", "Welcome", "to", "Brown", "SPH")
x3_vec <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)

x1_vec
x2_vec
x3_vec
```

Now we have 3 more vectors for which we can retrieve some information. Let's figure out the classes and lengths for each vector.

<span class="marginnote">Much of the code in these blocks is included to make the output display a little neater. Ignore most of it for now, and simply recognize that we've passed each of the objects above into the `class()` and `length()` functions.</span>

```{r inspect-vectors}
cat("x1_vec attributes",
    paste0(rep("-", 30), collapse = ""),
    paste("class:", class(x1_vec)),
    paste("length:", length(x1_vec)),
    sep = "\n"
  )

cat("x2_vec attributes",
    paste0(rep("-", 30), collapse = ""),
    paste("class:", class(x2_vec)),
    paste("length:", length(x2_vec)),
    sep = "\n"
  )

cat("x3_vec attributes",
    paste0(rep("-", 30), collapse = ""),
    paste("class:", class(x3_vec)),
    paste("length:", length(x3_vec)),
    sep = "\n"
  )
```

However, a single vector can contain values of only one class. In fact, if we try to mix classes, R will convert all elements of the vector into a single class. In the example below, R converts the numerical value 5 into a character because it doesn't know how to convert the string we provided into a number.

This process of changing value classes is known as **coercion**.

```{r mixed.class.vector}
x4_vec <- c(5, "So-called 'Arthur King'!")

# R coerces the numeric value into a character
c("class" = class(x4_vec[1]),
  "numeric?" = is.numeric(x4_vec[1]))
```

<span class="marginnote">You can check specific class types with a large number of functions. A few examples to demonstrate their general form: `is.numeric()`, `is.character()`, `is.logical()`, `is.vector()`.</span>

We see the vector's class is `character`. If we print the first element of the vector, we'll see R has wrapped it in quotation marks, indicating that the number 5 has been saved as a string (a series of characters).

```{r coerced.value}
x4_vec[1]
```

The implication here is important. Say you wanted to perform a logical or arithmetic operation on the first element. What would be the result?

```{r coerced.operation, error=TRUE}

# arithmetic operation
x4_vec[1] + 5

# equivalence with another numeric
x4_vec[1] == 5

# equivalence with another string
x4_vec[1] == "5"
```

Something interesting happened... the arithmetic operation failed because the first element of `x4_vec` was a character string, but the other two operations succeeded!

In the latter case, we might not be all that surprised: after all, we compared two strings we knew were identical. However, in the second example R implicitly coerced our character "5" into a numeric value and was able to compare it successfully to the numeric value we proposed.

Familiarize yourself with how R (or any programming lanuage you happen to be using) handles different classes and objects. All languages have their quirks in this regard, and recognizing these special cases early on will save you a lot of grief in the future.


### Matrices

In most epidemiologic data analysis, you might not end up dealing with matrices all that often. Because most of the data sets epidemiologists use contain mixtures of numeric, string, and other variable formats, we tend to use data frames.

However, you should still be familiar with matrices as, depending on your line of work, they may come in handy.

<span class="marginnote">For instance, you might actually need to do linear algebra, in which case, you may need to use a matrix. In addition, for very computationally demanding tasks, R can operate on matrices much faster than on data frames. We'll largely ignore these issues for now, but we'll look at a couple of instances in which matrices can be used to generate nice figure layouts for [data visualization](/data-visualization.html).</span>

Matrices can be multidimensional, but for the sake of our emotional stability, we'll consider matrices in up to three dimensions.

A two-dimensional matrix is essentially a vector:

```{r matrix-2d-1}
mat1 <- as.matrix(c(6, 7, 8))
mat1
```

However, because the elements are now indexed by both row and colum, we need to refer to each element by its specific coordinates.

For example, if we want to retrieve 7 from the matrix, we need to tell R that we want the element in row 2, column 1, which we can do as follows:

```{r matrix-2d-2}
mat1[2, 1]
```

If we wanted the third row:

```{r matrix-2d-3}
mat1[3, ]
```

If we wanted the first colum:

```{r matrix2d-4}
mat1[, 1]
```

With such a small matrix, these operations might seem a bit daft, so let's consider a larger numerical matrix.

```{r matrix-nd-1}
n1 <- 1:100
n2 <- 901:1000

mat2 <- matrix(c(n1, n2), nrow = 100)

# show the first 10 rows of the matrix
mat2[1:10, ]

# print total number of rows and columns
dim(mat2)
```

Be careful with matrices, though:

```{r matrix-nd-2}
mat3 <- matrix(c(n1, n2), nrow = 50)

mat3[1:10, ]
dim(mat3)
```

Because we told R we wanted a matrix with 50 rows, the first vector we specified was distributed across the first two columns, while the second vector was distributed across the third and fourth columns.

That's fine if it's what we wanted. Let's say, though, that we wanted a matrix with 50 rows and 4 columns but wanted it filled out row-by-row:

```{r matrix-nd-3}
mat4 <- matrix(c(n1, n2), nrow = 50, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
mat4[1:10, ]

# NOTE
# Here, we return rows 41-50 from mat4, but the output will label them 1-10.
# That's because R returns our request to us as its own matrix.
mat4[41:50, ]
```

In general, specifying the features you want in as much detail as possible will be the safest route, and may save you a good deal of grief in the future.

Say we wanted to get the column and row sums for this matrix. Easy!

```{r matrix-nd-4}
colSums(mat4)
rowSums(mat4)
```

Say we wanted to multiply every number in the matrix by 123456. Easy!

```{r}
mat4 * 123456
```


### Lists

Lists are very flexible objects in R. Think of them like chest of drawers into which we can store basically any other type of object. This feature of lists makes them useful for storing all sorts of data. In fact, when we get to fitting regression models, we'll see that the fitted model objects R returns to us are essentially stored as lists containing the estimated models, the data used to fit the model, regression diagnostics, and more.

A quick demonstration of storing multiple objects in a list:

```{r list-example}
# Object 1: Vector
my_vector <- 4:10

# Object 2: Matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(1:20, ncol = 4, byrow = T)

# Object 3: Dataframe (first 15 rows of iris)
my_df <- datasets::iris[1:15, ]

# Object 4: List
my_list <- list(vector = my_vector,
                matrix = my_matrix,
                dataframe = my_df)

my_list
```

Now, let's interrogate the list so we can get familiar with its features.

First, we saved each of the three objects into their own space within the list. _The objects are still separate from one other. In other words, we have not merged them._ Each of these spaces possesses a name, which we assigned in the code above.

```{r list-ex-names}
names(my_list)
```

We can query each of the objects individually:

```{r list-ex-extract}

my_list$vector
my_list$matrix
head(my_list$dataframe)

```

Alternatively, we could have accessed each object using a few different methods, each with slightly different effects. Let's focus on the dataframe to demonstrate.

Access using single brackets and name of the list element:

```{r list-ex-extract-1brackstring}
my_list["dataframe"]
```

Access using double brackets and name of the list element:

```{r list-ex-extract-2brackstring}
my_list[["dataframe"]]
```

The difference between what each of these calls returned is subtle but important. Recall the chest of drawers metaphor we applied to lists.

The list is the chest, each element is a drawer, and each drawer is filled with particular contents.

1. When we use single brackets, we pull the drawer out of the chest. However, we _do not access the contents of the drawer directly_.

2. When we use double brackets, we pull the contents out of the drawer, which means we can access them directly and act upon them as if they were not in the list at all.

To see the implications of how we query the list, we can try to perform some operations on the dataframe using each method of accessing it.

```{r}
# access the list element (pull out the drawer)
head(my_list["dataframe"])

# access the dataframe itself (pull out the contents of the drawer)
head(my_list[["dataframe"]])
```

In the first case, R did not apply the `head()` function because we did not access the contents of drawer we wanted.

The same bracket principle applies if we access elements and their contents using the numerical index of the list.

```{r list-ex-extract-1bracknum}
head(my_list[3])
```

```{r list-ex-extract-2bracknum}
head(my_list[[3]])
```

```{r list-access-table, echo = F}
tibble::tribble(
    ~ `Access method`,
    ~ Example,
    ~ Returns,

    'list["elementName"]',
    'my_list["dataframe"]',
    'Element',

    'list[elementIndex]',
    'my_list[3]',
    'Element',

    'list[["elementName"]]',
    'my_list[["dataframe"]]',
    'Element contents',

    'list[[elementIndex]]',
    'my_list[[3]]',
    'Element contents',

    'list$elementName',
    'my_list\\$dataframe',
    'Element contents'
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "List access summary")
```

In addition, we can place chests between drawers: in other words, we can **nest** lists within lists.

<span class="marginnote definition">
**Nesting** Placing objects of the same or similar type within one another. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_(computing)).

```{r matryoshka-doll, echo = F, fig.margin = T, fig.cap = "Think of [Matryoshka (Russian nesting) dolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). &copy; BrokenSphere / [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Floral_matryoshka_set_2_smallest_doll_nested.JPG) (cropped)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/matryoshka-doll_BrokenSphere_Wikimedia-Cropped.jpg")
```

```{r nested-lists}

# select first n rows from each example dataset
n1 <- 15
n2 <- 30
n3 <- 50

# create a subset of each dataset
iris_sub  <- datasets::iris[1:n1, ]
airq_sub  <- datasets::airquality[1:n2, ]
quake_sub <- datasets::quakes[1:n3, ]

# store some info about the iris dataset
# info: ?datasets::iris
nl1 <- list(data = iris_sub,
            nrows = nrow(iris_sub),
            ncols = length(iris_sub))

# store some info about the airquality dataset
# info: ?datasets::airquality
nl2 <- list(data = airq_sub,
            nrows = nrow(airq_sub),
            ncols = length(airq_sub))

# store some info about the precip dataset
# info: ?datasets::quakes
nl3 <- list(data = quake_sub,
            nrows = nrow(quake_sub),
            ncols = length(quake_sub))

# store dataset summaries to list
datasummary_list <- list(irisdata = nl1,
                         airquality_data = nl2,
                         quake_data = nl3)
```

Before we look at `datasummary_list`, sit with the code above for a minute and think about what you expect `datasummary_list` to look like...

We saved three lists, each containing a dataset along with some basic information about that dataset.

Next, we took these three lists and put them all into another list.

```{r nested-lists-output}
datasummary_list
```

There's the whole thing, but we'll take a minute to pick apart the elements of `datasummary_list`.

First, we named each of its elements:

```{r nested-list-names}
names(datasummary_list)
```

We can look at the first element, in which we stored a subset of the `iris` data:

```{r iris-nested-list-names}
names(datasummary_list$irisdata)
```

<span class="marginnote">Did we have to access this list directly? Have a look back at the list access table above.<span>

If we wanted to see the `iris` data and the information we saved about it:

```{r}
datasummary_list$irisdata$data
datasummary_list$irisdata$nrows
datasummary_list$irisdata$ncols
```

Note, too, that you can mix access methods, depending on your needs:

<span class="marginnote">Which dataset are we accessing?</span>

```{r}
head(datasummary_list[[3]]$data)
```

We'll see some lists later on in a few worked examples, as we've only scratched the surface. But even with what we've learned so far, hopefully your brain is starting to think about different ways me might use lists to store, manipulate, and analyze data. Data analysis and programming is in part an act of creativity!

```{r fun-list}
s1 <- "Okay"
s2 <- "that's all about lists"
s3 <- "for now!"

totally_unnecessary_list <- list(firstbit = s1,
                                 secondbit = list(s2, s3))

cat(paste0(totally_unnecessary_list[[1]], ","),
           totally_unnecessary_list[[2]][[1]],
           totally_unnecessary_list[[2]][[2]], sep = " ")
```

### Data Frames

As public health researchers using R, you may be spending most of your time working with data frames.

Data frames are a [rectangular data format](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/ch01.html), that is, a format which generally stores data with a series of labeled columns (variables) and observations (rows).

We've already seen a couple of data frames. Here are a few more that R contains by default.

```{r data.frame-examples}
class(chickwts)
head(chickwts)

class(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

Data frames lend themselves well to common epidemiologic analyses, but first, we should get a feel for how they behave.

We've seen that `head(dataframe)` will return the first handful of rows in the data frame (as a data frame, it turns out).

We might also want to inspect some other properties of a dataset.

```{r data.frame-str}
str(mtcars)
```

The `str()` function gives us a nice, concise report on the number of rows and variables, in addition to the value class of each variable.

Sometimes, we may want to query some of these attributes directly:

```{r data.frame-attrs}
nrow(mtcars)
length(mtcars)
names(mtcars)
```

The outputs from `nrow()` and `length()` returned to us the number of rows and columns, respectively, while `names()` returned the column names for us.

We can extract columns from the dataset as vectors if we want to operate on them directly:

```{r data.frame-extract-column}
class(mtcars$qsec)
summary(mtcars$qsec)
```

We could also summarize all the variables at the same time, simply by passing the data frame to `summary()`.

```{r data.frame-summarize}
summary(mtcars)
```

Look carefully at the output from our summary. Does anything look off?

I would say we should take a look at a few of the variables, which, despite having been stored as numeric, appear to be categorical variables.

Let's check the number of unique values stored in each variable:

```{r data.frame-checkvals}
sapply(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))
```

It looks like we might want to treat `cyl`, `vs`, `am`, `gear`, and `carb` as categorical.

<span class="marginnote">To view more information about the `mtcars` dataset, type `?mtcars` into the console.</span>

Specifically, we'll treat `cyl`, `gear`, and `carb` as ordinal, and we'll treat `vs` and `am` as binary.

<span class="marginnote">Remember, categorical variables assign an observation to a particular group. For example, if we had a column for the car's manufacturer, we might have categories such as Chevy, Honda, or Ford. Ordinal variables are special cases of categorical variables in which the levels have some sort of natural ordering. For example, finishing place in a race: 1, 2, 3.</span>

```{r data.frame-makefactors}

# create new variables in mtcars by converting the
# numeric ordinals into factors
mtcars$cyl_fct <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$gear_fct <- as.factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb_fct <- as.factor(mtcars$carb)

mtcars$vs_fct <- as.factor(ifelse(mtcars$vs == 0, "v-shaped", "straight"))
mtcars$am_fct <- as.factor(ifelse(mtcars$am == 0, "automatic", "manual"))

str(mtcars)
```

Take a minute to look at the output of `str()`. We have 5 new factor variables.

Technically, we could have analyzed the variables without converting them, but let's summarize the new ones anyhow.

```{r data.frame-sumfactors}
# we index mtcars so as to inspect only the variables we just created
summary(mtcars[, 12:16])
```

Not the prettiest summary, but note how R gives us the number of observations within each category for each factor. We'll look at more readable ways to summarize factors in a future section.

### Other Object Classes

Various subfields of epidemiology and statistics provide an array of object classes that are beyond the scope of this tutorial. For instance, an object with the class "graph" describes the components and structures of a [graph](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html). The information stored in this object would typically allow one to manipulate, analyze, and visualize the graph.

## Conducting Operations on Objects

### Arithmetic Operations

It may come as no surprise that you'll be doing a fair bit of arithmetic while coding, whether you're doing quick calculations in the console or creating variables derived from some arithmetic combination of other variables.

R respects grouping operations and handles mathematical operations as one might expect.

For instance, we can do some quick scratch calculations and print them directly to the console.

<span class="marginnote">In fact, R can be a handy calculator if you run it from the command line!</span>

```{r scratch-math}
5 + 10
0.25 * 9 + 0.75 * 3
(5 ^ 2 + 10 ^ 3) / 50
8 %% 3
8 %/% 3
```

```{r arithmetic-operators, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
  ~Operator,
  ~Function,

  "+",
  "Add",

  "-",
  "Subtract",

  "^",
  "Power",

  "*",
  "Multiply",

  "/",
  "Divide",

  "%%",
  "Modulus (remainder)",

  "%/%",
  "Modulus (remainder)",

  "%*%",
  "Matrix multiplication"
) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Arithmetic operators")
```

For more information, refer to [R's documentation on arithmetic operators](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Arithmetic.html).

### Logical Operations

We already saw one example of a logical operation, when we checked to see if `x1` was equal to 10. Statistical and epidemiologic analysis relies heavily on implementing logical operations and checks for truth, and so it is a good idea to master these operators early---and to use them often.

```{r logical-operators, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
  ~Operator,
  ~Function,

  "==",
  "Check equality of two values",

  "<",
  "Less than",

  "<=",
  "Less than or equal to",

  ">",
  "Greater than",

  ">=",
  "Greater than or equal to",

  "& (or &&)",
  "AND",

  "| (or ||)",
  "OR"
) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Logical operators")
```

When combining various operators, some will take [precedence](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Syntax.html) over others, and it's important to get a feel for this hierarchy to avoid unexpected results while programming.

### Recycling

In short, **recycling** refers to the reuse of an input object (or objects) to produce an output.

Recycling is a _very_ important concept in R. First, recycling can make your code more efficient. Second, if you forget that R recycles, you might unwittingly perform an operation that spits out a bunch of wrong answers.

That's a pretty abstract description, so let's look at a few examples to develop our intuition a bit.

First, recall the operators we covered in the the prior two sections, as well as vectors.

Say we wanted to add 5 to each of 3 numbers. Rather than specifying the arithmetic operation separately for each number, we could store those numbers to a vector and tell R to add 5 to the vector:

```{r vector-recycle}
numvec <- c(10, 40, 50)
numvec + 5
```

See what happened? R added 5 to each vector element separately.

If we wanted to perform separate additions on each number, we could do so easily, [as long as the longer vector's length is a multiple of the shorter vector's length](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781593273842/ch02s03.html):

```{r vector-recycle2}
numvec + c(5, 10, 90)
```

Did you notice the difference, though? Because the vector lengths were equal, R _did not_ recycle 5, 10, and 90 to add each to each item in `numvec`. Rather, it added 5 to `numvec[1]`, 10 to `numvec[2]`, and 90 to `numvec[3]`

However, attempting to execute the following operation results in a warning, because 3 cannot be divided evenly by 2:

```{r vector-recycle3}
numvec + c(5, 10)
```

Notice, however, that the second, unnamed vector _was_ recycled in this case. Looking at the output, we can see that R executed the following operations: 5 + 5, 40 + 10, and 50 + 5. In other words, R recycled the shorter vector until it was finished operating on `numvec`.

You might imagine this result was not really what we were looking for if we wanted R to add 5 to each element in `numvec` and then add 10 to each element in `numvec` and return the results for both sets of operations.

When we get to **for loops** and **functions**, we'll see how we can get R to do these sorts of tasks for us.
